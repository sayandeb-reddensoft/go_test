      <h3>Hi {{.Name}},</h3>
      <p>We received a request to delete your Clenz account.</p>
      <p>
        To confirm this request, please use the OTP below. This OTP is valid for
        the next 15 minutes:
      </p>
      <p class="otp-code"><b>{{.Code}}</b></p>
      <p>
        Once confirmed, your account will be marked for deletion. You’ll still
        be able to log in and use your account normally for the next
        <b>30 days</b>. After that, all your data will be permanently deleted
        and cannot be recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this wasn't you or you’ve changed your mind, simply ignore this email
        or log in again to cancel the deletion request.
